# Project Story: Blocked In
### Inspiration
We realized that accountability and consistent progress are key to staying focused. Whether it’s being motivated by friends or noticing daily improvements, these small wins can make a big difference. This insight inspired us to create Blocked In, a platform designed to help people build focus and consistency in a fun and interactive way.

### What It Does
Blocked In helps you stay focused by encouraging daily improvements. As you achieve your goals, you build a sturdy tower that visually represents your progress. The more consistent you are, the taller and stronger your tower becomes. This gamified approach makes staying focused engaging and rewarding.

### How We Built It
We developed Blocked In using a combination of tools and frameworks:

Streamlit: For deploying the web application efficiently.
SupaBase with PostgreSQL: To manage our backend database for user data and progress tracking.
Three.js: For rendering the 3D tower model, which represents user achievements.
Our development process focused on integrating these technologies seamlessly to create a smooth user experience.

### Challenges We Ran Into
Like any project, Blocked In had its fair share of challenges. Some of the major hurdles we faced included:

Database Integration: Connecting the backend database with the frontend to ensure smooth user interactions.
3D Rendering: Implementing the tower visualization using Three.js and ensuring it rendered correctly in the web application.
Overcoming these challenges required persistence, creative problem-solving, and collaboration.

### Accomplishments That We're Proud Of
We’re proud of several milestones we achieved during the development of Blocked In, including:

Successfully connecting the database to the signup, login, and friends page.
Creating a visually appealing and functional tower model using Three.js.
Building a solid foundation for a user-friendly application that motivates and engages.

### What We Learned
Working on Blocked In was a tremendous learning experience. Some of the key takeaways include:

Version Control: Keeping our codebase organized and collaborative.
SQL: Managing databases and querying data effectively.
Teamwork: Leveraging each team member’s strengths to overcome challenges.
Streamlit: Efficiently deploying and iterating on our web application.
Command Line Tools: Streamlining our workflow and debugging processes.
### What's Next for Blocked In
We have exciting plans for the future of Blocked In:

Cooperative Towers: Introduce a collaborative feature where users can build towers together, further enhancing accountability and connection with friends.
Enhanced Features: Expand the app with more gamified elements, personalized goals, and detailed progress tracking to motivate users even more.
